# Soduko-Solver
A DSA project based on the concept of Backtracking, Recursion, and Dynamic Programming
Sudoku is a popular and interesting puzzle solver game in the newspaper.
This game has a board where you have to fill in integral values. 
With the help of a backtracking algorithm, we can build a sudoku solver.
A backtracking algorithm is a technique for solving the problem recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, i.e., one Piece at a time, 
The backtracking algorithm will have a start point, an Intermediate checkpoint, a Point not getting the feasible solution, and an End with the feasible solution.
Every Piece of the board will start from the starting point and reach the intermediate checkpoint.
If the solution is not feasible, it will backtrack to the starting point. This process will continue until we get a feasible solution.
